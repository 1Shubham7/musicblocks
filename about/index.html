      <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>


      <p><a href="http://www.devinulibarri.com/Bio.html">Devin Ulibarri </a> has contributed functional and
        user-interface designs. Many of his contributions were
        inspired
        by the music education ideas, representations and practices (e.g. aspects of matrix, musical cups) developed
        and published by Dr. Lawrence Scripp with whom Devin studied at New England Conservatory and for whom he
        worked
        at Affron Scripp & Associates, LLC.</p>
      <p>
        Many students contributed to the project as part of Google Code-In (GCI) and Google Summer of Code (GSoC).
