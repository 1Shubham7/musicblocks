Design work for concept and UI by Devin Ulibarri, inspired by some ideas (e.g. aspects of matrix) that Dr. Larry Scripp (New England Conservatory and Center for Music and Education) teaches.

Some art ideas contributed from Chie Yasuda (Mouse idea). She also was very patient with Devin as he worked on all of this--thanks Chie!

So much coding done by Yash Khandelwal as part of Google Summer of Code (GSOC) 2015. Great work, Yash!
