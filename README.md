# MUSIC-BLOCKS

 Music Blocks a collection of manipulative tools for exploring fundamental musical concepts in an integrative and fun way.

### USING MUSIC-BLOCKS
Music Blocks is designed to run in a browser. It is derived from Turtle Blocks JS which can be found [here](https://github.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs). You can run it directly from index.html, from the [github](rawgit.com/khandelwalYash/Music-Blocks/master/index.html) repo, or by setting up a local server.

Once you've launched it in your browser, start by clicking on (or dragging) blocks from the Matrix palette. Use multiple blocks to create Music.

You can add blocks to your program by clicking on or dragging them from the palette to the main area. You can delete a block by dragging it onto the trash can. Click anywhere on a "stack" of blocks to start executing that stack.
